she
has
studied
how
using

paper
based
forms
could
help
patients
with
low

her
work
suggests
such
patients
find
the
conversational

building

not
just
essential
completing

actually
enables
them

innovation
and
productivity
the
challenge
professor
redmiles
says
lies
finding
ways
promote
trust
among
people
who
cannot
meet
face
face
how
can
virtual
teams
develop
and
create
trust
and
what
steps
can
they
take
get
back
track
when
that
trust
breaks
down
great
expectations
the
heart
trust
better
understanding
among
people
professor
redmiles
says
fostering
understanding
means
taking
careful
look
the
different
expectations
people
bring
the
table
those
expectations
can
straightforward
such
responding
emails
within
hours
they
can
more
complex
such
whether
collaborators
are
passive
assertive
when
comes
problem
solving
people
even
have
expectations
about
body
language
professor
redmiles
notes
the
bottom
line
that
every
collaborator
team
has
expectations
and
when
they
set
appropriately
and
then
met
trust
engendered
strength

his
research
has
applications
for

work
accessible
computing
focuses
the
interplay
technology
users
and
their
community
notably
she
understands
that
accessible
computing
functionalities
are
not
necessarily
limited
people
with

all
have
challenges
that
overcome
through
collaboration
for
example
when
carrying
lot
things
might
rely
systems
like
the
automatic
door
opener
for
wheelchair
users
embracing
this
idea
that
technology
design
that
starts
with
people
with

can
benefit
people
all
abilities
she
stresses
that
people
with

are
not
just
the
subjects
research
they
the
actors
designing
for
interdependence
another
important
tenet
professor
branham
work
shifting
the
focus
from
independence
interdependence
for
example
working
with
researcher
amy
hurst
and
toyota
develop
device
that
helps
blind
users
navigate
indoors
she
also
considering
external
influences
the
user
sense
physical
and
social
well
being
when
the
system
makes
mistake
people
who
are
sighted
sometimes
step
and
try
help
she
explains
but
can
scary
have
stranger
grab
you
and
interrupt
your
travel
which
can
potentially
put
you
harm
way
she
now
working
address
such
interdependent
interactions
this
and
other
devices
lead
more
positive
outcomes
algorithms
and
ethics
examining
how
the
technology
interests
marginalized
people
are
interdependent
professor
branham
research
also
reveals
difficult
tensions
for
instance
while
gender
recognition
algorithms
can
help
blind
woman
infer
the
gender
approaching
stranger
they
also
can
adversely
affect
the
transgender
community
through
miscategorization
constructing
her
research
team
include
people
with
variety
disabilities
and
gender
identities
branham
has
found
way
better
understand
the
ethical
dimensions
technologists
must
consider
she
purposefully
designs
her
team
mirror
the
communities
trying
serve
want
create
technologies
that

all
empowering

why
did
you
choose
irvine
for
your
studies
lot
universities
offer
software
engineering
specialization
computer
science
but
not
consider
software
engineering
stand
alone
discipline
this
leads
the
universities
providing
more
courses
that
are
focused
towards
computer
science
and
very
few
courses
software
engineering
irvine
the
other
hand
offers
curriculum
that
geared
specifically
towards
software
engineering
additionally
the
program
irvine
forms
perfect
blend
between
the
practical
and
research
worlds
thereby
allowing
the
students
make
more
knowledgeable
decision
about
their
future
what
has
been
your
favorite
class
far
and
why
the
three
classes
took
first
quarter
irvine
were
best
classes
far
those
classes
were
software
engineering
software
architecture
and
user
interface
design
and
evaluation
the
mix
these
three
classes
gave
smooth
transition
into
graduate
research
oriented
studies
while
software
engineering
was
highly
research
oriented
user
interface
design
and
evaluation
moved
into
more
practical
applications
and
software
architecture
provided
combination
both
these
classes
also
helped
decide
the
next
classes
that
wanted
take

have
you
done

every
professor
here
has
immense
knowledge
about
their
research
area
well
the
overall
discipline
and
willing
share
that
with
the
students
addition
the
weekly
seminars
have
professors
from
other
departments
and
schools
talking
about
their
research
which
gives
the
students
overall
idea
where
the
field
headed
what
has
been
the
most
unexpected
part
your
experience
when

why
did
you
choose
irvine
for
your
graduate
studies
originally
came
here
research
sustainable
human
computer
interaction
hci
with
bill
tomlinson
the
green
lab
this
was
the
only
lab
could
find
that
was
really
focused
looking
hci
from
sustainability
standpoint
whether
that
looking
agriculture
and
agroecology
sustainable
polycultures
and
things
like
that
but
when
got
here
started
focusing
more
policy
communication
which
got
thinking
about
how
hci
and
policy
making
could
improve
sustainability
what
has
been
your
favorite
class
far
favorite
informatics
class
was
in4mtx
265
theories
the
information
society
with
paul
dourish
the
class
really
helped
think
about
the
broader
societal
implications
technology
and
provided
historical
perspective
that
made
realize
how
many
today
questions
about
technology
have
been
asked
for
decades
even
centuries
also
because
much
what
looking
through
policy
how
constituents
communicate
with
their
policy
makers
last
spring
took
class
the
sociology
department
social
movement
theory
with
david
snow
and
david
meyers
didn
know
anything
about
social
movement
theory
and
really
enjoyed
studying
everything
from
protests
mexico
and
vietnam
the
sunflower
movement
and
the
umbrella
movement
the
class
helped
translate
these
actions
into
policy
considerations
have
you
had
internship
full
time
job
this
past
summer
worked
the
congressional
management
foundation
nonprofit
washington
that
works
directly
with
congress
was
doing
data
analyses
for
different
congressional
offices
constituent
satisfaction
delivering
books
different
congresspeople
offices
and
stuff
like
that
two
summers
before
that
was
the
johns
hopkins
applied
physics
lab
looking
game
development
for
training
intelligence
analysts
use
video
games
mitigate
cognitive
biases
what
research
have
you
been
involved
done
accessible
hci
research
looking
how
printer
technologies
can
used
help
people
with
disabilities
particular
research
into
printing
tactile
tools
for
the
blind
also
researched
ways
teach
physical
therapists
how
use
printers
augment
assisted
technologies
for
example
making
customized
grips
pair
crutches
making
augmented
prosthetics
what
has
been
the
best
part
your
experience
far
everything
has
been
great
experience
but
especially
having
people
question
what
know
for
the
past
year
and
half
remember
the
first
class
took
with
melissa
mazmanian
who
asked
why
are
you
really
here
what
you
want
really
blew
mind
happy
here
get
paid
ask
big
questions
pretty
great
what
has
been
the
most
unexpected
part
your
experience
definitely
didn
think
doing
research
policy
congress
came
here
study
sustainability
hci
but
something
really
pulled
toward
asking
questions
about
why
social
movements
were
trying
use
certain
policy
communications
for
pushing
sustainability
general
and
looking
these
social
movements
and
how
they
weren
working
realized
that
there
might
something
bigger
could
terms
helping
sustainability
looked
from
policy
standpoint
what
are
your
aspirations
for
the
future
over
the
next
four
years
working
dissertation
hope
have
impact
how
congress
uses
technology
working
directly
with
people
who
are
designing
technology
congress
the
short
term
helping
them
would
wonderful
beyond
that
not
sure
haven
had
chance
other
than
for
online
class
don
yet
know
want
teach
into
industry
any
advice
prospective
graduate
students
interested
the
program
background
research
the
professors
that
you
want
work
with
not
just
one
but
multiple
professors

focus
the
culture
the
department
love
the
feel
this
department
and
how
diverse
everyone
research
but
also
how
inclusive

the
support
that
you
get
think
that
made
the
biggest
difference
for
important
look
for
inclusive
environment
with
lot
different
options
because
most
students
switch
advisers
their
first
few
years

uci
for
one
professor
but
ended
changing
advisors
make
sure
the
department
great
fit
for
you

why
did
you
choose
irvine
for
your
studies
most
universities
offer
computer
science
but
was
looking
for
something
less
technical
and
geared
toward
software
engineering
and
software
architecture
professor
from
imperial
college
london
recommended
study
with
richard
taylor
irvine
contacted
taylor
and
told
that
was
interested
having
student
applied
and
fortunately
was
accepted
what
has
been
your
favorite
class
far
and
why
have
liked
many
classes
far
but
favorites
were
software
architecture
and
information
retrieval
enjoyed
the
former
because
the
topic
want
specialize
and
the
professor
was
seasoned
expert
the
field
and
the
latter
because
was
mostly
project
oriented
and
had
the
freedom
implement
requirements
preferred
have
you
done
internship
before
coming
irvine
worked
for
eight
years
software
development
company
argentina
making
software
for
the
financial
industry
started
software
developer
and
after
four
years
was
promoted
team
leader
have
you
been
involved
research
what
project
and
what
role
working
with
taylor
the
computational
state
transfer
coast
research
project
because
was
also
working
teaching
assistant
participation
was
limited
learning
what
had
already
been
done
and
creating
proof
concept
monitoring
suite
for
applications
developed
using
coast
beginning
fall
2014
will
working
thesis
that
will
related
coast
then
expect
contributing
more
what
has
been
the
best
part
your
experience
far
the
best
part
experience
has
been
learning
about
many
different
areas
and
technologies
have
taken
courses
that
have
exposed
ubiquitous
computing
information
retrieval
and
machine
learning
and
also
given
deeper
understanding
software
engineering
software
architecture
and
programming
since
international
student
living
different
country
for
two
years
and
getting
know
new
people
experience
itself
recommend
anyone
interested
what
has
been
the
most
unexpected
part
your
experience
did
not
know
that
many
courses
would
research
oriented
for
some
reason
thought
that
courses
would
practical
with
assignments
implement
what
learn
class
fortunately
there
are
many
courses
that
nature
but
students
need
pay
attention
which
courses
they
choose
what
are
your
aspirations
for
the
future
before
coming
irvine
was
unsure
about
what
wanted
professionally
because
liked
software
architecture
but
also
other
things
now
after
being
exposed
many
fields
know
that
want
software
architect
once
finish
will
work
the
industry
hopefully
challenging
projects
architect
team
what
your
advice
prospective
students
who
may
interested
the
program
they
should
take
time
research
exactly
what
the
program
offers
what
courses
are
available
and
also
talk
current
students
what
like
about
software
engineering
irvine
that
the
courses
are
very
diverse
and
easy
take
courses
that
are
aligned
with
what
you
expect
the
best
part
experience
has
been
learning
about
many
different
areas
and

than
have
hoped
for
this
reason
the
wics
committee
have
put
their
heads
together
compile
list
things
they
wish
they
knew
earlier
make
sure
you
can
benefit
from
them
now
apply
for
internships
and
jobs
early
doesn
matter
you
scared
don
feel
prepared
want
figure
out
first
just
apply
your
resume
isn
ready
take
day
fix
and
start
applying
like
crazy
because
the
longer
you
wait
the
harder
gets
there
are
less
available
internships
the
school
year
progresses
because
companies
begin
filling
spots
early
the
summer
prior
the
best
time
start
applying
before
and
during
your
fall
semester
quarter
keep
eye
applications
opening
between
july
and
august
and
your
chances
getting
the
job
will
much
higher
than
you
wait
until
winter
side
projects
gpa
obviously
you
want
pass
your
classes
and
the
best
you
can
but
the
end
the
day
companies
don
care
too
much
about
your
gpa
more
about
what
you
know
and
how
you
apply
you
have
stellar
gpa
but
side
projects
and
lacking
portfolio
going
hard
stand
out
you
don
have
create
the
next
award
winning
mobile
application
even
just
small
grocery
list
application
you
made
your
own
time
can
make
the
difference
between
moving
forward
interview
not
start
practicing
for
the
technical
interview
like
yesterday
this
information
doesn
tend
make
transfers
and
freshman
soon
should
and
key
getting
your
first
internship
you
need
able
pass
the
whiteboard
coding
interview
order
land
that
first
job
and
the
best
way
that
practice
wics
recommends
the
following
resources
get
you
started
leetcode
hackerrank
cracking
the
coding
interview
explore
different
parts
the
computer
science
industry
doesn
have
mean
just
programming
all
day
that
something
that
interests
then
yay
but
not
don
fear
there
are
many
aspects
computer
science
that
could
your
ally
don
forget
explore
the
different
realms
including
security
web
dev
and
much
more
there
something
for
everyone
within
the
tech
industry
don
afraid
trying
find
what
you
love
within
seek
out
opportunities
work
teams
apart
from
technical
skills
companies
really
value
how
well
you
work
with
other
people
especially
plays
large
part
evaluating
how
well
you
behavioral
interviews
consider
participating
hackathons
and
maybe
get
cool
side
project
done
two
birds
one
stone
signing
for
research
groups
and
taking
project
courses
try
learn
new
languages
and
tools
don
rely
what
you
learn
class
while
important
that
you
are
comfortable
with
the
languages
you
use
your
coursework
also
important
diversify
your
skills
and
make
yourself
more
marketable
the
future
one
way
you
can
this
learning
other
languages
tools
that
your
school
may
not
including
their
courses
such
javascript
angular
rest
php
ruby
this
will
also
set
you
apart
from
all
the
other
college
students
who
are
applying
for
the
same
positions
you
are
while
making
your
resume
stand
out
you
can
start
adding
these
skills
your
toolkit
through
free
online
classes
diving
and
starting
your
own
side
project
before
you
set
out
conquer
something
new
make
sure
that
you
feel
confident
with
least
one
programming
language
such
python
java
this
will
help
you
with
technical
interviews
you
will
get
ghosted
and
rejected
let
just
learn
and
grow
from
matter
how
good
your
resume
the
reality
you
will
get
ghosted
and
rejected
companies
the
first
rejections
and
ghostings
might
hurt
lot
applying
over
hundred
companies
and
hearing
back
from
only
handful
might
have
you
questioning
whether
not
you
will
actually
secure
internship
the
most
important
part
stay
strong
and
learn
from
each
those
rejections
create
document
where
you
self
evaluate
yourself
after
each
interview
after
talking
recruiters
career
fair
reflect
where
you
did
well
and
where
you
have
room
for
improvement
use
that
constructive
criticism
and
work
improving
certain
skills
that
you
are
even
more
prepared
for
upcoming
interviews
learn
about
the
companies
you
are
applying
for
lot
people
apply
jobs
but
don
really
know
anything
about
the
company
aren
really
passionate
about
the
work
that
these
companies
don
just
apply
jobs
just
because
they
look
good
resume
but
rather
figure
out
what
you
enjoy
what
kind
company
culture
you
see
yourself
working
and
the
type
company
you
want
represent
additionally
you
might
want
figure
out
why
you
want
work
there
what
interests
you
and
why
you
think
you
would
good
fit
answering
these
questions
ahead
time
will
better
prepare
you
pitch
yourself
your
interview
lot
these
companies
have
thousands
upon
thousands
people
applying
these
jobs
many
the
applicants
will
have
similar
skills
and
levels
experience
what
will
set
you
apart
from
the
sea
applicants
how
much
you
fit
into
the
company
culture
and
how
passionate
you
are
about
the
work
you
will
doing
when
you
speak
with
conviction
because
you
are
convinced
that
the
things
you
are
saying
are
true
when
you
tell
your
interviewers
you
will
succeed
when
you
start
your
internship
your
interviewers
will
believe
make
backup
plans
when
choosing
classes
important
prepared
for
things
not
going
the
way
you
want
expect
them
getting
classes
computer
science
hard
but
not
impossible
all
about
how
you
plan
and
prepare
schools
with
impacted
programs
common
for
the
class
you
had
your
eye
full
before
your
enrollment
window
even
opens
throwing
off
your
original
plan
regardless
you
will
this
happens
everyone
all
the
time
which
why
important
that
you
have
back
plan
prepared
and
willing
play
around
with
your
options
lot
upper
division
courses
have
minimal
prerequisites
shouldn
challenging
find
replacement
course
that
fits
the
bill
okay
not
know
exactly
what
you
want
until
maybe
like
senior
year
lol
struggled
with
finding
what
wanted
with
life
freshman
and
looking
back
wished
hadn
spent
much
time
stressing
out
worrying
come
believe
that
life
will
figure
itself
out
long
you
know
what
you
like
what
you
passionate
about
and
all
that
fluff
people
will
drawn
what
excites
them
most
naturally
fret
not
you
okay
imagine
you
ten
years
into
the
future
that
class
grade
project
that
felt
heavy
will
hardly
distant
memory
being
open
and
optimistic
yet
hard
working
will
get
you
much
farther
than
your
performance
school
the
end
the
day
remember
that
everyone
else
learning
too
you
may
see
others
your
classes
clubs
who
seem
like
they
have
all
figured
out
the
summer
internship
year
plan
and
everything
between
but
matter
how
much
they
seem
know
they
still
have
lot
learn
too
whether
learning
new
language
just
learning
shower
regularly
hey
least
they
learning
with
technology
always
changing
your
greatest
asset
the
computer
science
industry
your
ability
learn
rather
than
feeling
intimidated
insecure
those
you
believe
have
all
figured
out
take
the
opportunity
learn
from
what
they
have
offer
and
remember
that
you
likely
have
something
offer
them
too
talk
your
peers
sometimes
counselors
can
only
much
help
guide
you
through
your
academic
career
sometimes
the
best
advice
comes
from
those
who
are
going
through
have
been
through
the
same
things
you
your
peers
ask
them
about
their
experiences
and
you
can
benefit
from
their
wisdom
they
can
also
help
you
plan
out
your
classes
share
tips
which
classes
avoid
and
give
you
emotional
support
well
wish
had
talked
other
students
about
which
classes
best
suited
needs
before
putting
much
time
and
money
into
them
even
though
didn
get
this
advice
soon
would
have
liked
eventually
caught
and
was
able
get
really
helpful
technical
interview
tips
going
straight
peers
ask
questions
you
confused
about
something
likely
that
someone
else
too
don
afraid
raise
your
hand
post
your
class
forum
about
any
questions
you
have
know
all
get
imposter
syndrome
and
think
that
our
questions
might
dumb
but
every
student
has
imposter
syndrome
and
everyone
gets
little
scared
before
raising
their
hand
clicking
post
just
know
that
the
answers
you
get
your
question
will
help
you
and
many
other
students
the
class
and
you
will
get
your
answers
sooner
rather
than
later
spent
countless
hours
trying
figure
out
what
error
means
when
could
have
simply
posted
quick
question
and
would
have
received
answer
within
minutes
someone
eventually
asked
that
same
question
days
later
and
got
answer
minutes
from
don
make
those
mistakes
ask
your
questions
and
get
them
answered
you
don
waste
your
valuable
time
network
network
network
know
you
have
probably
already
heard
about
how
important
networking
but
really
that
important
from
recruiters
professors
even
your
peers
everyone
has
valuable
advice
and
can
support
you
and
your
career
goals
different
ways
networking
can
help
you
improve
your

resources
for
your

even
introduce
you
potential

you
never
know
where
your
next
big

hackerrank
are
all
good

exploring
different
baking
recipes
learning

etc
there
much
you

with
increasing
interest
coding
among
younger
students
there
are
ton
opportunities
work
coding
teacher

will
the

few
well

ninjas
and
don
worry
you
not

learning
curriculum
these
programs
often
use
teaching
tools
scratch
thunkable
minecraft
for
education
that
are
designed
super
